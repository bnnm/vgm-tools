HOW TO DOWNLOAD + DECRYPT + EXTRACT BEATMANIA IIDX ULTIMATE MOBILE ASSETS (by bnnm)
(note: these tools were mostly pieced together from little crap I had around, feel free to use as a base for better tools)

* needs python3 and .NET +4
* decryption by default doesn't delete original files, so may need +15GB (data) + 15GB (decryption) + 15GB (unity extraction)
  * open decryption.py and set "REMOVE_ORIGINALS = True" if needed

STEPS:
- unzip the files into some dir

- modify current-url.txt if needed
  - current is loaded using an API but too much effort to reverse, can be gotten via memdumps/etc
  - as of v1.18.1 / 2023-04

- launch urls.py
  - this will download + decrypt ablist.json if not found (delete it to redownload)
  - then will generate urls.txt
  - ablist.json can be used to find about certain

- drag and drop urls.txt into dl.py to download bgm assets
  - remove any useless urls if needed, or uncomment "filter" and put stuff there, etc
  - check urls-errors.txt if generated

- launch decrypt.py
  - uses bium.exe + ablist.json to decrypt all files
  - you can also drag a single file too

- use some unity extractor to get data from .dec files
  - since UnityAsset Studio is slow and memory hungry, may try this instead:
  - install UnityPy in the command line: pip install UnityPy
  - launch unity-extract.py to automatically extract all music files (only)

- NOTE: when updating the bgm rip, preferably don't overwrite old/unchanged files, so old timestamps are kept
