HOW TO RIP AUDIO (.BAO) FROM ASSASSINS CREED 1 AND SIMILAR GAMES

- .forge audio uses the "BAO" format. A BAO file can be audio events/headers/data/etc.
  * We want to extract all "usable" BAO and then clean up the data excess.
  * NOTE: Assassin's Creed 1 (X360) can't be decompressed ATM

- extract all .forge archives with !scimitar_forge.bms
  * This will create multiple .compressed files and some normal extensionless files
  * You can skip dataXX_streamedsounds(XXX) if you don't need voices
  * cmd .bat:
    for %%x in (*.forge) do  quickbms.exe -d !scimitar_forge.bms "%%x"

- extract all .compressed with !scimitar_forge_compressed_bao.bms
  * Open .bms and change config first:
    * endian XXX (PC: little, PS3/X360: big)
    * TARGET_GAME (depending on the target game)
    * BAO_CHANNELS_MIN (2ch or more, set to 0 for all sounds)
    * other configs: don't change unless you know what you are doing
  * Note that BAOs may be repeated in many different .compressed files
  * cmd .bat:
    for /R %%x in (*.compressed) do quickbms.exe -Q -o !scimitar_forge_compressed_bao.bms "%%x" 2>> nul

- put all extracted BAOs in the same folder
  * BAO_0xNNNNNNNN (from .compressed files)
  * Common_BAO_0xNNNNNNNN (from some .forge files)
  * English/French/etc_BAO_0xNNNNNNNN (same, voice audio, optional)

- most BAOs should be playable with vgmstream now, but many are unneeded excess data
 
- use bao_sorter.py to move all usable BAO to a "ok" final dir
  * configurable
  * "usable" BAO are those that were extracted with matching header+data
    * so if BAO_CHANNEL_MIN is 2, there are no mono headers so mono data will be skipped

- If all went all usable BAOs should be ready and playable
  * Note that files can't be moved or renamed (use TXTP to get more playable stuff)
  * Also note that not all BAO_* are playable, some are companion files for other BAOs
    (in Assassin's Creed 1 only BAO_0x20NNNNNN are audio headers, but in other games name varies)
  * AC1 PS3 also has a few unused (non-referenced or without companion) BAOs

- There may be a very few big streams (Common_BAO) that aren't moved. Most should
  be 1ch ambiance, but some are layered streams that would normally move. I didn't find
  corresponding layer headers, and they seem unused (for example AC1 PS3 has extra
  BAOs that AC1 PC doesn't), but due to how complex those formats are it's hard to
  say if it's really a bug, be aware if you miss some song. Particularly Shaun White
  Skateboarding is missing quite a few, others less so.
