dc/naomi/atomiswave dump mini guide

- get file dump
  - file has chd: extract with chdman.exe (found in mame release)
     chdman.exe extractcd -i gdl-0012.chd -o gdl-0012.gdi 
     * creates a .gdi for vgmtoolbox
  - file has cue (redump): may need to convert to first (try gdidrop)
  - file has .gdi and has 4 tracks: atomiswave conversion, 
    - use atomiswave.bms on track03 instead to dump files from it
  - Naomi has a big .BIN with all data, extract
    - decrypt big .BIN like: DEScrypt.exe <key> <file>  //2370D3EFC19EB55E = cleopatra fortune plus
    - will create a .BIN.dat > use dsf_ext.py

- use some ISO tool (vgmtoolbox/etc) to open dump (.cue or .gdi)
  - if only shows very few files, probably it's not reading filesystem correctly
  - DC dumps usually have a few separate tracks, track03 has main game but filesystem is modified
  - atomiswave roms are encrypted, must be decrypted first (AW>DC conversions pre-decrypt them)

- find files in the dump and extract
  .DRV: standard driver
  .MLT big: has all data together, for dsf_make.py
  .MLT small, .MSB, .MPB, .MDB, .FBP, FOB, .OSB: separate data, for mlt_make.py
  .ADX, .p16, .p04: streamed (for the later 2 use txth + PCM16/AICA)
  - no files/Naomi file: use dsf_ext.py to get sequence data (also vgmtoolbox for ADX)

- run .py tools depending on the files you have 
  * tools can be run as-is (will try to autoguess data based on filenames on dir)
  * also drag and drop files
  * tools need bin2psf.exe and psfpoint.exe nearby

- dsf_ext.py: extracts from .BIN (mainly naomi w/o filesystem) known DSF stuff (MLT, etc)
  - use only if you couldn't extract from the filesystems (as files won't be named = harder to match)
- mlt_make.py: mixes .MSB (midi) + .MPB (samples) into new .MLT
  * by default tries various combos but may need to specify manually files (Drag and drop)
    * ST01.MSB + ST01.MPB, ST02.MSB + ST02.MPB, ... (auto, names match)
    * ST01_SQ.MSB + ST01_PG.MPB, ST02_SQ.MSB + ST02_PG.MPB,  (manual, names don't match)
    * JOJO.MSB + PA01.MPB, JOJO.MSB + PA02.MPB, ... (auto, if there is only a single .MSB and many .MPB)
      * in this case of "same MSB for all files", need to call with correct track (can't detect):
        dsf_make.py PA01.MLT -t 0, dsf_make.py PA02.MLT -t 1, .... 
- dsf_make.py: takes full .MLT + .DRV and makes .DSF/MINIDSF
  - can make dsf from mixed MLT, but needs to set -t 0 (since bank is a fake mix)
  - doesn't support all driver versions
  - if volume is too low try increasing it with -v 128 [0..255]
- dsf_autotimer.py: takes .DSF/MINIDSF and auto-times them if possible based on internal sequence info
